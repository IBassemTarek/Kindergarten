# Kindergarten

“Kindergarten” is an application to teach reading Qur’an for children and adults - the idea is inspired by the system of Qur’an Alwah used in writers’ circles in the past. The first version of the program contains: Al-Fatihah + Ayat Al-Kursi + a complete Amma part.
This project is not for profit, Its purpose is to draw closer to God.
